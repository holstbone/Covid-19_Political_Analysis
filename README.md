# Covid-19_Political_Analysis

In late September 2020, President Trump stated the following regarding the number of Coronavirus cases in the United States: “If you take the blue states out,” he said, “we’re at a level that I don’t think anybody in the world would be at. We’re really at a very low level.” This statement seems to be an alleged causal relationship -- that political leaning of a geographic area is the reason that Coronavirus cases are higher in some locations than others -- and it is, in my opinion, ripe for a deeper dive exploratory data analysis. Let's call it a fact check on President Trump's statement.
